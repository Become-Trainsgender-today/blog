**hello.**

so, it took me a month to finally get around to posting something... but welcome to the first blog post in 2024!

with this post, i want to introduce a new topic i've been meaning to talk about for a long time and that is.. TRANSIT!

transit has always been a very big passion of mine, growing up i've wanted to start driving busses, slowly going over more towards
the trains / trams side and now i've been a big fan of all of them for nearly a decade.

i've recently thought about how i could implement transit into this already existing blog, changing from something thats more
"lifestyle" based to something thats very niche is very hard to do, but i think i finally have an idea.

this idea i like to call TramReview.

in this series, i will review every single tram line in my city of leipzig, though only including lines that regularly run since event lines are very random when it comes to things like routing and vehicle use and because theyre generally just hard to come by.

after im done with my city, which will probably take a couple of months considering i want to buy a camera to take my OWN photos rather than just taking photos from somewhere else,
i want to expand into different cities, which i havent really decided on.

maybe ill do them state by state, basically going through all of saxony, then going to brandenburg and so on, or ill do them randomly, basically whenever im in a city with trams, ill do my best to review them.


my goal is to go into a lot of detail, talk about diversions a specific route can take, talk about the rolling stock and my opinion on it and concluding with my general thought about its usefulness in this big city that we have.

lets see if i'll be able to do that :)


love all of you, hope you'll hear from me soon again <3
