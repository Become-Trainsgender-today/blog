**hello.**

well, so thats that. i just learned that i have a basically sub-zero chance to actually finish this school year, great feeling.
im currently failing:
- physics, because my teacher sucks
- chemistry, cuz i didnt study enough
- geography, cuz i failed one test (tho i still can save that)
- and history, because my teacher sucks.

i gotta be honest tho, it wasnt all my teachers fault, i fucking suck too, since i got into linux systems and have been basically doing things everyday, this shit has taken over my entire life because its just so fun, and this includes my school life too sadly.

but.. what now?

i have no idea. obviously, im gonna keep going and try to safe this so i can get my degree and go study CS or something similar, but what if i cant do that?

i do have multiple options, i definitely wanna do something thats fun for me. i saw multiple apprenticeships at the german train company Deutsche Bahn for a sys-admin-esque job, that seems like it could be fun, but is that really me? i dont know, sysadmin stuff is fun but i cant tell if thats actually what i wanna do as a job or not. but i guess i could try?

i think its a great option to try it out. just finally finish an apprenticeship so i can actually do something in life instead of just sitting my ass off doing stupid things.
honest to god, quitting my first apprenticeship was so dumb, im now in a position where i have to basically finish school or hope somebody else will take me, but what do i know, maybe im lucky?

i guess we'll find out, ill just hope for the best and see if i can actually save my school stuff and get a good degree and do what i wanna do afterwards. we'll see :3

love all of u, thank you for reading and especially thanks to all my friends who are there for me when i have to vent about things <3333 -val
