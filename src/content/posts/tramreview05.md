**Hello.**

My name is Valerie, I'm a trans girl from Germany who is really, really, REALLY interested in transit.

Since I was about 6 years old, I had a really big interest in transit and wanted to work in that field, I nearly ended up becoming a tram driver that way, before deciding to quit.
Either way, I still wanted to do something transport related, which is how I came up with the idea of writing a blog a couple of months ago. I ended up never liking the blog
design I was writing on and the platform (which was hexo), which is why I never ended up writing a lot about transit and just ended up talking about my life, until I just stopped blogging completely.

If you want, you can still look at the blogs on [this website](https://trainsgender.today/blog/).

On the old blog, you may also be able to see something that looks familier, which is TramReview. It's a project I've planned since the start of my original blog, but never got around to doing.
On this blog, I want to restart that idea completely.

TramReview is basically as the name already says, a review of the tram lines in my city of Leipzig. I will start off with my local line, going around all of the other lines in a circle until I've done every single line. A big task, but something I'm definitely down for if I end up finding the time to do so, so don't expect any parts to come out anytime soon. :P

I've already started work on the first part by taking a lot of pictures on the line of certain trams, but I have not yet gotten around to actually writing anything.

After I'm done with my city, I will either go on to do TrainReview, doing all lines (including regional train lines, not just suburban ones!) that run out of my city or into my city.
If I don't decide to do that, I will either go back to doing personal blogs, talking about life and stuff, or going on to do BusReview in my city, or expanding TramReview to other cities.

The former is possibly the path that I will be going, since I'm also planning to review at least one line in every city in Germany and others that have a tram line, just as a sort of special.

Anyways, hope you will have a great day and hope you will all enjoy my blog in the future.

xoxo - valerie
