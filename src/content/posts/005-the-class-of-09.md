ï»¿**hello.**

ok so before i start of this blog post, there'll be 4 disclaimers (yes sorry)

1. tomorrow i wont be posting a blog, gotta study for an exam now and yeah probably wont have the time to do so, might also stop doing these daily and rather do them weekly or whenever i just feel like it. :3
2. im definitely not a good reviewer, i fucking suck at reviewing anything because my mind can only really say "yeah thats good" when talking about something i genuinely like
3. if you dont want spoilers for the class of 09, id rather not read this blog since im gonna talk about it (lol)
4. **CW: suicide, manipulation, stupid fucking high school drama and pedophilia (ikr its crazy)**

so lets go.









so i was really bored right now and decided after seeing 5 clips in a row on tiktok about the class of '09, that i really wanted to get into it. idk the voice acting just made it seem so funny, its my perfect humor. stupidly dark humor about suicide and emotionless was something i always liked, even though i only wanna do one of those things sometimes.

mostly because i was laying in bed, but also because im generally not a fan of having to download a fucking game to play through a story (sorry not sorry VN fans), i decided to watch a nearly 1.5 hour long full playthrough of the game.

honestly, it was fucking great.


the story was so good. picking off with nicole, who's the main character of the entire VN, having to move places for the billionth time and then her fucking dad killed himself because of her??? that shit is crazy.

then going to the school part, the way all the characters were written, the stupid fucking jock who doesnt know shit, the horny anime boy who wants to fuck loli's or whatever the fuck -- everything was lowkey so well executed.

i loved the alternate story lines too, if theres one things that i love about visual novels its genuinely the fact that you can just basically change the story however you want it to happen, basing it on the decisions you take throughout it. i love that shit so much.


either way, since most of the novel as basically just nicole fake-fucking people and talking with jecka and whatever the fuck, im gonna jump right towards the last alternative ending i saw.. gonna call it "the nice nicole ending".


basically, nicole started being nice to everyone, actually going out with all of the people she was well.. asked out by. this, while obviously being a good thing on a social morality point of view, fucked her up and exhausted her really bad.
turns out, a rumor started spreading while this was happening, a rumor that she "fucked the entire lacrosse team". her trying to get out of the situation, tried to talk with the pedophile counseler to get her out of it, but he told her that the entire faculty knew, even the principal so she had no way out of it.


in basically every alternate ending, nicole holds a small monologue towards the end, in my opinion it reads and sounds like a typical myspace bulletin. just rambling on thoughts and explaining a small situation like how she ended up in a mental ward, how her life went on to be good and so on.



but this time it was different. she talked about how things can fuck up so much, if you are just nice to everyone and ignore all the warning signs placed along the way.


she ended the monologue with the following sentence (transcribed):
"do it like me and you'll end up like me.. or like my dad."

me thinking this was just a funny little play on her wanting to kill herself again like she's been saying throughout the entire VN, i didnt think too much of it, i chuckled a bit but thought that was the end.


yeah no. after this sentence she wrote:
"when you are reading this, i am dead."
and there was a picture of her hanging in front of her pc, with myspace open.

idk why, but that part of the story just really fucked me up, i dont think ive felt a connection with anyone in the VN, but i guess the idea of someone actually being pushed to suicide just for being nice... i guess in a sort of fucked up way i can see how that would genuinely happen in real life.
its not really a secret that being nice to everyone isnt a good way to live, for i had to realize that myself, otherwise i wouldve never come out of the closet and honestly, mightve killed myself too once i would have gotten the oppurtunity to do so.

but idk it still shocked me so much, even if its a kind of corny ending.


this visual novel was crazy as fuck, everyone who read through this entire thing even after skipping my content warnings and disclaimers, should definitely go ahead and watch it themselves. you may not agree with my opinion, but tbf it is also very subjective so i cant blame you.


either way, again im sorry for not posting a blog tomorrow, if i do find the time and a topic to talk about, maybe ill still actually write something down, but we'll see tomorrow.

love all of you guys <3 -val
