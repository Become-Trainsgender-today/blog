﻿**hello.**

yay time to do another funny depressing topic cuz i cant get my mind off of things and just gotta put them to paper(or into my zsh shell??? idfk) so ye lets start.

love. love is a great thing, i love a lot of things. i love my laptop, always by my side in the worst moments. i love my blåhajar (tea, hayley, roman and jane, pics added below).
but love is also the worst. especially, when it's to something that doesn't love you back.

if it wasnt obvious by now, obviously this blog post isnt about just loving in general, its about crushing on people and how fucking depressing it can get.

i have this friend. theyre a great friend.. actually - an amazing friend. we do a lot of things together and we talk a lot, but also had some times where we were just sick of each other.
getting to the point, i love this person. and i don't mean in a friendship kind of way, i wish they were my significant other.
i love them so much, the way they act, the way they appreciate me as a person, the way they accepted my identity RIGHT from the start with only a couple of errors. its amazing.

i love when we spent time together, it's the greatest time for me even though it is hard for me to tell them that.

ever since i started crushing on them, my nights have been terrible. every single night i just lay in bed and wish i was with them, cuddling them, maybe a few kisses and generally just feeling safe.

...

but it's so hard to tell them. i just can't get myself to do it. there's too many signs that this person who i love, would never love me back.
it isn't about my gender identity, i can feel that, it's just the general interest that person has in me.

don't get me wrong, i know they like me and all... but not in a romantic way. it's so obvious.

... or maybe they just dont make it obvious?
i really don't know.

getting the courage is so hard, i've had a lot of rejections in my life, matter of fact, at 19 years old i have never had a relationship.
on one hand, this is mostly because of my general non-interest in social stuff, i can get around just fine socially but would never get myself into the trouble of actually socializing with a lot of people.
but it's also because of me. i can't deny it, i am a very confusing person. i usually jump from one topic to another and can't really interact in most conversations. i'm also very pre-judgmental about people, i will instantly dislike people just because of the first impressions they gave me.
that isn't a good thing and i know that, but i haven't been able to turn it off. i feel like it's mostly stemming from my general depression & gender dysphoria that's making me hate myself and everything around me, but i can't pinpoint it exactly.

either way, i hope that feeling fades. i really wish i could be with them, it'd be the goal of my life currently. finally having someone to rely on, someone to cuddle with when i'm sad and someone to have fun with.

.. but i guess that's gonna have to wait.

love you all :3 -val
