**hello.**

sorry for not blogging for a couple days, the past days have been... exhausting at best. but i still felt like posting something, so lets talk about my trip to berlin on the 2nd.

the trip was pretty spontaneuos, me and a friend just stood there and went like "hm we could go to halle (city close to me), but what about berlin?" and then decided that that was a better idea, mostly cuz my friend is vegan and we would have better food options than in a lowkey right-wing near nazi city lmao

we took the train at about 9:30 from the main station here and arrived at 13:20 in berlin, long ride, very exhausting cuz of so many people but somehow i was able to get through it without feeling too bad for the rest of the day. when we arrived, we instantly went to the dussmann kaufhaus.

the dussmann-kaufhaus is a big bookstore/everything store (department store?) in the middle of berlin selling tons of books, a lot of german ones but also a lot of books from other languages, including ukrainian and spanish and such.
i was mostly there because i always wanted to go there, but also because of one thing. the first part of the scott pilgrim book, ive been wanting to read it for the past couple of years (yes even tho i really only got into scott pilgrim this year about 3 months before the anime came out) but pirating a book written by an indie author wasnt really for me and tbh even if i did, i wouldntve read it because i dont like reading things digitally, i already stare enough at a screen as is and being able to read books just makes me shutdown for a bit from all of the electronic stuff around me.

either way, i spent about 50 minutes searching for the book, i walked around the english section - couldnt find it, i walked around the comic book section - couldnt find it, everywhere i went it was just.. not there, even though it was in stock on the website, but after those 50 minutes, i finally found it --- in the childrens comic section of the store. idk why it was there, but oh well, maybe they placed it wrong intentionally so people couldnt find it, considering its sold out basically everywhere or is put as a pre-order lmao

after spending an hour inside, i finally got out and then we decided to grab some food, obviously at a vegan place. it was a nice small burger place, the cashier was just nice and nothing more and tbh theres nothing extra to add except that the burger was good and the card machine thing asked me for a tip, which tbh is just weird idk why all small german stores decide to go the american way and pay like shit and then going with tips instead but oh well, doesnt seem like we can change that anytime soon.



either way, now getting to the important part, which i already mentioned in the title. surroundings can really change the way you feel about yourself, being in a city, with tons of people, none of them you know, you feel like you can do anything. no one will judge you, no one will hate on you, you can just... live freely. and thats an amazing feeling.
being in berlin means freedom for me, knowing tons of people around me are also queer, makes me feel safe. i know thats a thing in my city too, which im really grateful for, but its still such an awesome feeling when i can go to berlin because theyre so different at accepting it.

in my city, you still get stared at, quite a lot actually, but they dont actively go out of their way to bully you or curse at you or whatever, its honestly better than i expected since i still live in eastern germany, the right-wing part of germany, but in berlin its so different. everyone cares about themselves, no one cares about you or how you dress or whatever, you basically have complete anonimity. and thats such a good feeling which i will always love.

anyway, id say the trip went well. we took the train home at about 9pm, arrived at 12am and i went to sleep at 1am and felt like shit the day after, but that happens :3

love all of uuuuuuuuu thx 4 readinggg :33333 -val
