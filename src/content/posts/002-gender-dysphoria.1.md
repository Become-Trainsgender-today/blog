ï»¿**hello.**

today i decided i really wanna talk about a thing that has been destroying me for over a year now,
but has especially destroyed my well-being and life the past couple of days.

**gender dysphoria**

you know, waking up is fucking hard. before i go to school, i usually have to wake up AT LEAST an hour or two beforehand, otherwise i'll just end up being late because i can't dare to get out of bed.
i'm so actively depressed, every time i look in the mirror and see my stupid beard, my shaved head (hair was dead, had to do it) and just notice that i don't look close to even being a girl i want to rip off my entire skin and just end my life on the spot.
the only reason why i dont end up doing it, is because of my medication. i've been on antidepressants for the past 2 months, they've helped a lot with coming to peace with my suicidal thoughts and have made me lose this need of wanting to die. it was a very good decision on my end.
either way though, they will never help with gender dysphoria. this thing will always eat up myself and i don't think that will ever change, especially looking at the fact that getting an appointment for a therapist in this city has gotten fucking hard ever since covid happened. genuinely fucked up.
i wish i could just wake up tomorrow and be the girl i always dreamed of being, simple, cute and most importantly **happy**.

my plan right now is to start DIY hrt as soon as i can, living like this has been fucking hell, not even just for my mental wellbeing but also my social life - i mean - try to explain to cis hetero guys that you're a girl with a fucked up beard (shaving makes my skin bleed like crazy lol sensitive skin moment)!

either way, i have some other things i will talk about soon. things that are also depressing, but not as depressing as gender dysphoria can be.

trans rights are human rights.

love you all :3 -val
