ï»¿**hello.**

due to many, and honestly dumb reasons, i decided to switch my telephone number from my old one ive kept for !10! years to a new one, aswell as a new provider.
this was honestly one of the stupidest mistakes ive made in my recent time.

ive successfully locked myself out of my apple id, took me about A WEEK to get it back.

i dont know why its so stupidly complicated to get that shit fixed. i had to call them up, they obviously referred me to some support page which
idk i guess it works but whatever. after that, they had to INVESTIGATE FOR A WEEK! if im actually the person trying to log in to my apple id.

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO TAKE SO LONG??

look i hate praising google a lot, i think google fucking sucks as a company and generally speaking, i dont like that my data is being collected to support some stupid AI or whatever the fuck.
but GOOGLE DID IT SO WELL! i literally logged into my account, said i didnt have access, they told me to put in my security questions and password (if i remember correctly) and i could INSTANTLY change my number to my current one to log back in. that was perfect.

either way, the reason why i decided to talk about this now is because.. it just happened to me again.

ive successfully LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF MY PAYPAL WHERE I HAVE ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS GOING UGH!

i guess its not that big of a deal, considering those subscriptions are actively being deducted from my bank account instead of my paypal balance or whatever, but its still just so frustrating.

but.. their customer service is atrocious, which i guess is normal for a financial company, but its still annoying.

i tried resetting my password to get back into my account, it asked me for my security questions. "thank god" i said... oh if i just knew what was gonna happen next.

i put in my security question answer thingies, thought everything will be fine.. YEAH NO.
it asked me to verify my account with my phone number. obviously.

i tried it multiple times, different security questions, everytime i landed at that page.

i even tried to login through paypal checkout, because i heard somewhere that paypal caches that, and it did work.. to a certain degree. i was in my account, but i couldnt get to my settings, so that didnt work either.

now my socially anxious ass is gonna have to go home, call a stupid call center that cant do anything anyway and HOPE they can fix my account, otherwise i guess i have to figure out how to cancel my subscriptions from the specific websites instead of via paypal lol.

------ skipping to after class (yes i wrote this in class) ------

ok so i just called them up and i gotta say...... this was the best phone support i ever had in my life.

i usually know phone support as more of a burden, matter of fact, i used to work in a call center myself for over 3 months and god did i hate it, you just couldnt help anyone on the other end because you didnt have the systems they needed or the information was hidden in the middle of butt fuck nowhere.
but, i gotta say, they did their job very well.

i had to wait in line for 10 minutes, pretty normal for german call center lines so i cant complain that much, i had to put in my old number and the last 4 digits of my bank account through some automated system thingie, and that worked pretty well too so that was nice :)

after those 10 minutes, a surprisingly nice and happy person picked up, i explained my situation and she instantly got ahead and did everything i needed them to do.

my favorite part was towards the end of the conversation though, where i signed into my paypal, said "yeah it works" and she INSTANTLY hung up. idk what happened there, guessing it was just a mistake on her end, but it was genuinely very funny and made the conversation even better.


tl;dr for this part: paypal support was surprisingly good, 9/10 because of wait times :3


ok yea that was that, hopefully there wont be a part two where i gotta work on fixing another platform;;

love yall<33333 -val


(no funny image or video this time cuz idk theres nothing that fits to this)
