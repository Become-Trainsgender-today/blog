**hello.**

UGHHHHHHHHHH I HATE WINTER SO MUCH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

i really love wearing short clothes, t-shirts are fucking awesome especially if theyre tshirts i like (i.e. band shirts, political shirts or just cool looking ones :3) and shorts and skirts are fucking awesome too but ITS WAY TOO COLD TO WEAR ANY OF THAT.

i feel like when i wear a sweater or a hoodie, i instantly look like a guy. when i wear more revealing clothes at least i feel a bit of femininty which i love and enjoy, but I CANT WEAR THAT NOW UGH.

also, fuck talking about clothes, lets talk about life in general in winter. waking up is much harder since it only gets bright at like 9am, making my sleep schedule more fucked up AND THEN my room always gets cold since i have to get some fresh air in and when i close the window after a while and put on my heater it BARELY does shit, making my room feel like a fucking fridge.

and then when you finally decide to go out to chill with friends its just... depressing, you walk around with some mushy disgusting brown snow, slip every couple of meters because theres ice everywhere and you cant even ride your bike because its just way too slippery on bike paths and shit!

ok going back to clothes, you start wearing 4 fucking layers, are JUST warm enough to actually go out and then you arrive at school, your job or whatever and they ALL got the heating on to max and you just instantly start sweating everywhere. i hate that shit so much, same thing with stores in the city where you go in and out of, constantly switching between "warm :333 yayyy" and "UGHHHH IM FREEZING" every 2 fucking minutes its so disgusting

honest to god, i miss summer.
i can ride my bike, travel around, wear the clothes i want and chill with friends without being depressed.
its fucking awesome and no one can convince me otherwise.

anyways, sorry for the rant but just had to get that shit out lmao

love you guys -val<3
